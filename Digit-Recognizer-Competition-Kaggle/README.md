## README for Digit Recognizer Kaggle Competition

### Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my participation in the Digit Recognizer competition on Kaggle. The objective of this competition was to correctly identify digits (0-9) from images of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with various data processing and model tuning techniques, I achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set, placing me in the top 20 out of 1,940 participants.

### Competition Description

The Digit Recognizer competition on Kaggle challenges participants to correctly identify digits from the MNIST dataset. This competition is a great starting point for those looking to get into computer vision and machine learning. Participants were provided with a dataset of labeled handwritten digits and were required to develop a model to predict the labels of a test set of images.

- **Participation**:
    - 185,522 Entrants
    - 1,940 Participants
    - 1,940 Teams
    - 6,528 Submissions

### Dataset

The dataset used for this competition is the MNIST dataset, which includes:
- `train.csv`
- `test.csv`

To download the dataset, use the following Kaggle command:
```sh
!kaggle competitions download -c digit-recognizer
```

Each image is 28x28 pixels, and each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Normalization**: The pixel values of the images were normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: The labels were converted to one-hot encoded vectors for categorical classification.

### Model Description

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in this project includes several convolutional layers with ReLU activation, batch normalization, and max pooling. The final layers consist of dense layers, with the last layer being a softmax layer for classification into 10 categories (digits 0-9).

### Model Training and Evaluation

The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function. The training was performed with validation by splitting the dataset, and the performance was measured using accuracy.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Several hyperparameters were tuned, including the number of convolutional layers, number of filters, kernel size, activation functions, and the use of techniques like batch normalization and dropout.

### Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 100%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 99.8%
- **Test Accuracy**: 100% (achieved top 20 position out of 1,940 participants)
